    <p>This chicken pasta skillet meal is a tasteful combination of vegetables, chicken,<br> 
        and pasta prepared in a cast iron skillet. My family eats tons of this stuff. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><li>1/2 (8 ounce) package spaghettini</li><br>
                <li>5 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li><br>
                <li>8 roma (plum) tomatoes, halved and sliced</li><br>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li><br>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li><br>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li><br>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li><br>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li><br>
                <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li><br>
                <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li><br>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li><br>
                <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li><br>
                <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li><br>
                <li>1 red onion, chopped</li><br>
                <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li><br>
                <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li><br>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <h4><li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Stir in spaghettini and return<br> 
            to a boil. Cook pasta until it has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 6 to<br> 
            8 minutes. Drain well and keep warm.</li><br>

            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in tomatoes; cook<br> 
                until they soften and begin to break down. Stir in garlic powder, oregano, basil,<br> 
                salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup. Heat sauce through and reserve.</li><br>

            <li>Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a separate cast iron skillet over medium<br> 
                heat. Stir in chicken; cook until browned. Stir in garlic cloves; cook for 1<br> 
                additional minute.</li><br>
            
            <li>Remove chicken from skillet and reserve. Turn heat to high. Stir bell peppers,<br> 
                onion, and mushrooms into the skillet and cook until they begin to soften. Stir in<br> 
                browned chicken. Turn heat to medium and cook until chicken is no longer pink<br> 
                in the center and vegetables are cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li><br>

            <li>Toss chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce and hot pasta. Serve sprinkled<br>
                with Parmesan cheese.</li></h4>
