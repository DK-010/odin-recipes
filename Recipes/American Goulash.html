    <h1>American Goulash</h1>
    <img src="american goulash.jpeg" alt="american goulash" height="380" width="480"><br>
    <p>American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I<br>
        was growing up. They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of<br>
        buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of goulash<br>
        was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-<br>
        small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your<br>
        weeknight dinner rotation.

                stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5<br> 
                minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add<br> 
                garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li><br>
