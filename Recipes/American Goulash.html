                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I
                was growing up. They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of
                buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of goulash
                was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-
                small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your
                weeknight dinner rotation.</p>

                    <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground
                        beef and onion; cook andstir until beef is browned and 
                        crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5minutes.
                        Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 
                        3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian 
                        seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
                    
                    

                    <img src="step3.webp" alt="step3" height="380" width="380">
                    <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, 
                        about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced 
                        tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into
                        the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to
                        medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.</li>

                        Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely
                        tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.</li>
