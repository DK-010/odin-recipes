    <p>These bang bang wings are air fried, making them that much more awesome!<br>
        They’re tossed in a perfectly balanced sauce with a sweet heat that lingers in a way<br>
        that makes you want more. You could also grill, fry or roast them before<br>
        tossing them in the sauce. </p>
